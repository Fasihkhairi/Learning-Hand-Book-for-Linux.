# What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the core of various Linux distributions or "distros." It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and is designed to run on a wide range of hardware platforms.


## Why Use Linux?

There are several reasons to use Linux:

- **Open Source:** Linux is open-source, which means its source code is freely available, and anyone can modify and distribute it.
- **Stability:** Linux is known for its stability and reliability, making it a popular choice for servers and critical systems.
- **Customization:** Linux is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor it to their specific needs.
- **Security:** Linux is inherently more secure due to its permission-based file system and community-driven security updates.
- **Vast Software Ecosystem:** Linux offers a vast range of free and open-source software, including productivity tools, development environments, and more.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Many Linux distributions are free, making it a cost-effective choice for individuals and organizations.
- **Community Support:** The Linux community provides excellent support, with extensive documentation, forums, and resources.
