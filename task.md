   - Choose "Installer disc image file (iso)" and click "Browse" to select the Linux ISO file you downloaded earlier.
   - Click "Next."

5. **Guest Operating System:**
   - Choose the guest operating system. If your Linux distribution is not listed, choose "Linux" and the version that matches your distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).
   - Click "Next."

6. **Name and Location:**
   - Enter a name for your virtual machine and choose a location to store it.
   - Click "Next."

7. **Disk Capacity:**
   - Specify the disk capacity for the virtual machine. The recommended size depends on your Linux distribution and your needs.
   - Choose whether to store the virtual disk as a single file or split into multiple files.
   - Click "Next."

8. **Ready to Create Virtual Machine:**
   - Review your settings and click "Finish" to create the virtual machine.

9. **Customize Hardware (Optional):**
   - Before powering on the virtual machine, you can customize hardware settings like RAM, CPU, and network adapters.
   - Click "Close" when done.

10. **Power On the Virtual Machine:**
    - Click the "Power on this virtual machine" button.

11. **Install Linux:**
    - The virtual machine will boot from the Linux ISO you provided.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to install Linux. This involves selecting language, keyboard layout, disk partitioning, and creating a user account.

12. **Complete Installation:**
    - Once the installation is complete, remove the installation media (ISO) and restart the virtual machine.

13. **Login to Linux:**
    - Log in with the credentials you created during the installation.

## Notes:

- **VMware Tools:**
  - After installation, it's recommended to install VMware Tools within the Linux guest to enhance integration and performance.

- **Check VMware Documentation:**
  - Depending on the version of VMware Workstation you are using, some steps might differ. Refer to the [VMware documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/index.html) for any version-specific instructions.

This is a general guide, and specific steps may vary based on your Linux distribution and VMware Workstation version. Always refer to the documentation for your specific software versions for the most accurate information.
